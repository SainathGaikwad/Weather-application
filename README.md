# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# How to run this application

- First of all create the React + vite app using command npm install vite@latest
- Install Tailwind CSS
- Install axios by using the command npm install axios
- I have used Rapid API.com for Weather data. you can also use OpenWeatherMap for data. In Rapid API I have used "Weather Crossing Weather" API for free. Just change the API key for use in your application.
